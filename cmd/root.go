	Long: `Task Manager CLI is a lightweight command-line tool to help you organize and track your tasks.
You can easily add, complete, list, and prioritize tasks using simple commands.

Features:
- Add tasks with a description, due date, and priority
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- List tasks based on their status or priority
- Edit and delete tasks to keep your task list up-to-date

Example Commands:
- Add a new task: taskcli add --title "Complete report" --due "2024-09-10" --priority high
- List all tasks: taskcli list
- Mark a task complete: taskcli complete 1

Make task management simple and efficient with Task Manager CLI!`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
